# Purpose of the Article

In cybersecurity, the use of specialized operating systems is common; this article aims to present several Blue Team-oriented solutions.  
It does not intend to designate the “best” system, but rather to highlight the strengths of each depending on the user's profile and use case.  
These environments are designed to be ready-to-use, concentrating in a single ISO image the essential tools for each specialization.

# Roles and Their Requirements

The term "Blue Team" encompasses several specialties, each with its own missions, working methods, and software requirements.  
Here we focus on the most common roles. I use the french document [the ANSSI cybersecurity career map](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/panorama-des-metiers-de-la-cybersecurite) but you ccan refeer to the [SANS](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt36c2e63521272fdc/blt54d6532c72ff0a96/6580a12a2f46f77f08821fb1/Poster_Coolest-Careers_v0124_WEB.pdf).

## SOC Analyst (Security Operations Center)

**Primary mission:**  
The SOC analyst monitors the organization's information systems to detect suspicious or malicious activity.  
They identify, categorize, analyze, and qualify security events in real time or asynchronously, based on threat analysis reports.  
They also support incident response teams in handling confirmed security incidents.

**Tools required:**
- Log visualization and correlation
- Quick IOC analysis (hash, IP, domain)
- Simple attack simulation to test detection rules
- Network utilities (Wireshark, whois, curl, etc.)

**Beginner Friendly:** Yes

## DFIR Specialist (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)

**Primary mission:**  
This professional intervenes after a confirmed incident to determine its cause, assess the impact, and preserve digital evidence.  
DFIR typically combines two roles:

- Digital Forensic: Preservation, extraction, and analysis of digital evidence (disks, logs, memory)
- Incident Response: Attack analysis, containment, remediation, and feedback

**Tools required:**
- Forensic acquisition (disks, RAM)
- Artifact analysis (MFT, system logs)
- Memory investigation and timeline creation

**Beginner Friendly:** No (N2 level minimum)

## Threat Intelligence Analyst

**Primary mission:**  
The threat intel analyst collects, qualifies, and contextualizes threat-related information.  
They monitor threat actors, targeted campaigns, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).  
Their work is essential to detection and response teams.

**Tools required:**
- OSINT collection and IOC enrichment
- Static or dynamic malware analysis
- Integration with platforms like [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org), [Yeti](https://yeti-platform.io)

**Beginner Friendly:** Possible with supervision

## Defensive Pentester

**Primary mission:**  
This role simulates realistic attacks to test an organization's detection and response capabilities.  
They contribute to improving SOC efficiency by confronting it with adversary-like scenarios.

**Tools required:**
- MITRE ATT&CK emulation
- Simulated attack campaigns
- Sigma / YARA rule testing

**Beginner Friendly:** No (requires offensive/defensive experience)

# Using Distributions via WSL

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a Windows feature that lets you run a Linux environment directly in Windows, without the need for a complete virtual machine. This can be an interesting alternative for certain Blue Team applications.

## Advantages

- Native Windows integration: WSL distributions can be opened directly from PowerShell, Windows Terminal or Visual Studio Code.
- Direct access to Windows files: via /mnt/c, WSL lets you manipulate files stored on NTFS disks, which is handy for local analysis.
- Rapid deployment: a WSL distribution can be quickly installed from the Microsoft Store (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, Kali).
- Fewer resources than conventional VMs: ideal for less powerful machines.

## Limitations

- No native GUI (in WSL1): although WSL2 supports a form of GUI with wslg, experience remains limited or unstable for complex graphical tools.
- Restricted hardware access: no support for direct USB modules, so unsuitable for forensic acquisition or low-level network analysis.
- Some distributions not officially available: for example, SIFT or REMnux are not supplied in WSL-ready form.

## Use Cases

- Script testing (IOC, CTI)
- Log file analysis
- Sigma/YARA/OSINT automation
